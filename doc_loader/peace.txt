Peace

Peace is the gentle morning light,
That breaks the dark and ends the night.
It whispers calm in every breeze,
And paints the world with quiet ease.
Peace is the smile a stranger gives,
A promise kept, the way one lives.
It grows when hearts choose love, not fight,
And spreads its wings to heal the night.
Peace is not found in gold or fame,
But in kind acts, both small and plain.
A seed once sown in soil of care,
Becomes a garden everywhere.
So let us walk with open hands,
Across all seas, through every land.
For where compassion takes its place,
The world will shine in endless grace.
In quiet fields where soft winds roam,
Peace whispers gently, calling home.
No clash of swords, no thunderâ€™s cry,
Just tranquil blue across the sky.
A gentle hand, a hopeful heart,
Where kindness blooms, and hate departs.
The world united, dreams released,
In silent strength, we cherish peace.
Let every dawn bring calm anew,
With open arms and skies of blue.
For in each soul, let love increase,
And guide us on the path to peace.
